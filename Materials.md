# History and funny background videos
* Funny numberphile video on the seven bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W18FDEA1jRQ
* alternatively a more concise but less funny video on the same topic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZwSo4vfw6c
* Veritassium video on six degrees of separation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcxZSmzPw8k
* Erdos number https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G46ofdNDoy8
* Very pop science Barabasi video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i1o5cs-yk8 very funny though

# Background

* Strogatz - Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, Youtube lectures. "Intended for newcomers to nonlinear dynamics and chaos." [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbN57C5Zdl6j_qJA-pARJnKsmROzPnO9V]
* Newmann intro to networks lecture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPSt-xs_zWQ
* From the same series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6CqqlILBCI some motivation lots of standard models, some network measures, second half is community detection though
* Or Barabasi - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c867FlzxZ9Y - I don't like his obsession about scale free networks and his confident yet faulty assertion that all networks are scale-free but otherwise it's a pretty decent introduction


# Advanced
* Strogatz - Youtube Channel -
  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj1G_-P9EIMs4VpcgcOPxRw]
  Currently "Asymptotics and perturbation methods"
* Bianconi -large random complex networks- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6rP6mX1g2c covering ba graphs scale free stuff but then going kind of crazy with stuff about simplicial complexes

# Real world examples of dynamical networks
* food webs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVJ5BKcAhAg (fun but shallow)
* protein-protein interactions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc8XVP6Cjwc (fun but shallow)

# Biological networks
E.g.:
Quantifying Cell Fate Decisions for Differentiation and Reprogramming of a Human Stem Cell Network:
Landscape and Biological Paths
[https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003165]

(Also worth looking at Gene Regulatory Networks, Gene Co-expression Networks)
