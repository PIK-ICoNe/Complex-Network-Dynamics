Criteria for the seminar talks:

- Central concepts, methods and calculations of papers should be clearly explained
- Where possible implement simulations and compare the results to the simulation and calculation results from the paper
- Find complementary literature


A good talk:
- Speak at a reasonable pace
- Explain all concepts you need unless they are common knowledge for people with a bachelors degree in physics or related firlds
- Don't overload your slides
- You may use the blackboard as well if this is the more appropriate format for the topic (or part of it)
- Use figures to explain concepts and show results
- Test your talk for length
