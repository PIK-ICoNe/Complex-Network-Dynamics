Criteria for the seminar talks:

The Seminar talks should be 30-45 minutes

We will grade them in the following way:

## Choice of material (30%)
Is the material that is being presented well chosen?

- Is a consistent set of core concepts identified?
- Was additional material beyond the key papers provided identified and used?
- Were the points at which to go more in depth well chosen?

## Correctness and understanding (50%)
Was the chosen material and additional simulations well understood and key steps presented clearly?

- Were the chosen concepts presented correctly?
- Were simulation results presented completely?
- Was adequate context for the presented material given?
- Was everything explained clearly?

## Presentation (20%)
Was the talk and the presentation well done?


## A good talk:
- Speak at a reasonable pace
- Explain all concepts you need unless they are common knowledge for people with a bachelors degree in physics or related firlds
- Don't overload your slides
- You may use the blackboard as well if this is the more appropriate format for the topic (or part of it)
- Use figures to explain concepts and show results
- Test your talk for length
