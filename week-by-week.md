In this file i would like to organize materials and topics week by week to have a clearer understanding of what kunds of material we are actually looking for

# Week 1
* Meet students, 
* Explain how the course works (watch videos, read materials, think of 2 questions each to discuss/ask at in person meeting), 
* Hand out seminar topics (How soon can the first seminar happen and what do we do with the time before that? Some coding session on visualizing networks with python/Julia? This could benefit the talks)
