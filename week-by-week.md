In this file i would like to organize materials and topics week by week to have a clearer understanding of what kunds of material we are actually looking for.
Do we want the seminar talks to be coordinated with the lecture topic? When should they start? I would normally say week 3 is the earliest starting date

# Week 1 - Introduction
* Meet students
* Explain how the course works (watch videos, read materials, think of 2 questions each to discuss/ask at in person meeting)
* Hand out seminar topics (How soon can the first seminar happen and what do we do with the time before that? Some coding session on visualizing networks with python/Julia? This could benefit the talks)

# Week 2 - What are dynamics
* Here i'm a bit less versed, i guess we can do the strogatz lecture here that you found? Haven't watched it yet. Any reading?

# Week 3 - What are networks and why are they interesting
* Motivational material 1: Funny historical pop-science intro about KÃ¶nigsberg & 6 degrees
* Motivational material 2: Examples of all the different places where networks pop up (food webs, protein interaction, protein folding, cosmic web, social network, power grid, internet...) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66anxw_EuyQ
* Mathematical definitions: Lingo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkNdNpKUByM&list=RDCMUCGYSfZbPp3BiAFs531PBY7g&index=1 The first one of the series is all we need, the rest is in case someone is interested in what mathematicians do with the concept as opposed to what physicists do
* Read chapter 1 and 2 in Newmann review paper https://scholar.google.de/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=de&user=rQ68pVwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=rQ68pVwAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC and also chapter 2 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0302
* Task 1: Watch/read and come with questions
* Task 2: Find a topic that can't be thought of as networks and we will collectively try to prove you wrong
* Seminar Talk Idea 1: Introduction to SNAP http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html#communities: Present this collection of network data and vizualize some examples (unless we do that in the coding session, which would probably be better)
* Seminar Talk Ides 2: Introduction of one classic network, but which one? The Karate club? The Milgram paper? The moreno paper? All of those together?

# Week 4 - How to analyze networks
* Network Measures and the network science view: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6CqqlILBCI sadly it's almost 2 h long and has some overlap with week 2 (or 3 if we swap)
* Find other video on Network measures which is more concise and less about community finding? Maybe it's okay to do communities in detail... I mean most commonmeasures are mentioned at least
* Read chapter 3 in Newmann review paper https://scholar.google.de/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=de&user=rQ68pVwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=rQ68pVwAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC and perhaps also chapter 2 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0302
* Seminar Talk: Maybe a network measure that is less common but will become central in a later topic?

# Week 5 - Network ensembles and the null model
* Not sure we can find a good video on that but i think it's an important concept... Maybe we'll have to record this one ourselves? It doesn't need to be that long.
* Network ensemble example 1: ER networks (The chapter in the Newmann book was pretty good but also long)
* All the things you can compute and prove about ER networks (minus percolation perhaps?)
* Seminar Talk: Percolation

# Week 6 - Mechanistic network models for social networks
* WS networks and shortest paths
* BA networks and the degree distribution
* (My rewiring as an example of how to combine the two?)
* Seminar Talk: Marc and Carstens paper on rewiring

# Week 7 - Mechanistic models of spatially embedded networks
* RG networks ooh there was also an awesome paper onjust them... where they calculated lots of stuff analytically https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0203026
* Section 4 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0302
* Seminar Talk: My protein networks/plus maybe the other one in 3d

# Week 8 - The other angle on network ensembles - canonical network ensembles/ Exponential random graphs
* Ginistra Bianconi talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlldupobxQ This contains an ensemble definition
* And the second half of the lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO57MsROEsk This one includes lots of proofs, not sure how much is gained from this
* Seminar Talk:

# Week 9 (last session of 21, Christmas lecture) Mean fields and Master Equation
* Since i'm not sure if and how much material we can find on this perhaps we can do something gamy and workshoppy. I could give an actual in person lecture on this stuff and maybe we can apply the methods to silly examples from board games or something like that?
* Seminar Talk: Some paper that does this type of stuff, options would be the newmann paper (though that one's tricky and maybe we want to discuss it in week 6)

# Week 10 - 

# Week 11 - Dynamics on networks - Epidemics
* Is this too late to start dynamics on networks?

# Week 12 - Power flow stuff?

# Week 13

# Week 14

# Week 15

# Week 16
