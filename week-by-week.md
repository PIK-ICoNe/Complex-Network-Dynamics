In this file i would like to organize materials and topics week by week to have a clearer understanding of what kunds of material we are actually looking for

# Week 1 - Introduction
* Meet students
* Explain how the course works (watch videos, read materials, think of 2 questions each to discuss/ask at in person meeting)
* Hand out seminar topics (How soon can the first seminar happen and what do we do with the time before that? Some coding session on visualizing networks with python/Julia? This could benefit the talks)

# Week 2 - What are networks and why are they interesting
* Motivational material 1: Funny historical pop-science intro about KÃ¶nigsberg & 6 degrees
* Motivational material 2: Examples of all the different places where networks pop up (food webs, protein interaction, protein folding, cosmic web, social network, power grid, internet...) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66anxw_EuyQ
* Mathematical definitions: Lingo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkNdNpKUByM&list=RDCMUCGYSfZbPp3BiAFs531PBY7g&index=1 The first one of the series is all we need, the rest is in case someone is interested in what mathematicians do with the concept as opposed to what physicists do
* Task 1: Watch/read and come with questions
* Task 2: Find a topic that can't be thought of as networks and we will collectively try to prove you wrong

# Week 3 - What are dynamics
* Here i'm a bit less versed, i guess we can do the strogatz lecture here that you found? Haven't watched it yet Maybe it's better to swap weeks 2 and 3 and start with dynamics because i'm nowhere near done with networks

# Week 4 - How to analyze networks
* Network Measures and the network science view: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6CqqlILBCI sadly it's almost 2 h long and has some overlap with week 2 (or 3 if we swap)
* Find other video on Network measures which is more concise and less about community finding? Maybe it's okay to do communities in detail... I mean most commonmeasures are mentioned at least

# Week 5 - Network ensembles and the null model
* Not sure we can find a good video on that but i think it's an important concept... 
* Network ensemble example 1: ER networks
* Percolation
* All the things you can compute and prove about ER networks

# Week 6 - Mechanistic network models for social networks
* WS networks and shortest paths
* BA networks and the degree distribution
* My rewiring as an example of how to combine the two?

# Week 7 - Mechanistic models of spatially embedded networks
* RG networks
* My protein networks 

# Week 8 - Mean Fields and Master Equations
* This is sort of my pet topic but i still haven't figured out my ancient paper on this, it's enough material for its own session so that's why i'm putting it here

# Week 9 (last session of 21, Christmas lecture)

# Week 10 - The other angle on network ensembles - canonical network ensembles/ Exponential random graphs
* Ginistra Bianconi talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHlldupobxQ This contains an ensemble definition
* And the second half of the lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO57MsROEsk This one includes lots of proofs, not sure how much is gained from this

# Week 11 - Dynamics on networks - Epidemics
* Is this too late to start dynamics on networks?

# Week 12 - Power flow stuff?

# Week 13

# Week 14

# Week 15

# Week 16
