In this file i would like to organize materials and topics week by week to have a clearer understanding of what kunds of material we are actually looking for

# Week 1 - Introduction
* Meet students
* Explain how the course works (watch videos, read materials, think of 2 questions each to discuss/ask at in person meeting)
* Hand out seminar topics (How soon can the first seminar happen and what do we do with the time before that? Some coding session on visualizing networks with python/Julia? This could benefit the talks)

# Week 2 - What are networks and why are they interesting
* Motivational material 1: Funny historical pop-science intro about KÃ¶nigsberg & 6 degrees
* Motivational material 2: Examples of all the different places where networks pop up (food webs, protein interaction, protein folding, social network, power grid, internet...)
* Mathematical definitions: Lingo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkNdNpKUByM&list=RDCMUCGYSfZbPp3BiAFs531PBY7g&index=1 The first one of the series is all we need, the rest is in case someone is interested in what mathematicians do with the concept as opposed to what physicists do
* Task 1: Watch/read and come with questions
* Task 2: Find a topic that can't be thought of as networks and we will collectively try to prove you wrong

# Week 3 - What are dynamics
* Here i'm a bit less versed, i guess we can do the strogatz lecture here that you found? Haven't watched it yet Maybe it's better to swap weeks 2 and 3 and start with dynamics because i'm nowhere near done with networks

# Week 4 - How to analyze networks
* Network Measures and the network science view: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6CqqlILBCI sadly it's almost 2 h long and has some overlap with week 2 (or 3 if we swap)
* Find other video on Network measures which is more concise and less about community finding? Maybe it's okay to do communities in detail... I mean most commonmeasures are mentioned at least

# Week 5 - Network ensembles
