In this file i would like to organize materials and topics week by week to have a clearer understanding of what kunds of material we are actually looking for

# Week 1
* Meet students
* Explain how the course works (watch videos, read materials, think of 2 questions each to discuss/ask at in person meeting)
* Hand out seminar topics (How soon can the first seminar happen and what do we do with the time before that? Some coding session on visualizing networks with python/Julia? This could benefit the talks)

# Week 2
* Motivational material 1: Funny historical pop-science intro about KÃ¶nigsberg & 6 degrees
* Motivational material 2: Examples of all the different places where networks pop up (food webs, protein interaction, protein folding, social network, power grid, internet...)
* Mathematical definitions: The language of graph theory
* Task 1: Watch/read and come with questions
* Task 2: Find a topic that can't be thought of as networks and we will collectively try to prove you wrong
